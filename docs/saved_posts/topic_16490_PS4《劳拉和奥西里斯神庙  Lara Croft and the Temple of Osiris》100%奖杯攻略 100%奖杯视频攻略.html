In order to earn this trophy, you will have to complete every challenge in the game which amounts to doing just about everything in the game. The length of this part will vary on whether or not you went for challenges during your first run of each Tomb. Below I listed every challenge and gave my recommendations on how to beat them.<br/><br/><i><b>主线关卡挑战</b></i><br/><b>Pyramid of Osiris</b><br/><u><i>1. Bronze Point Challenge (40,000)</i></u><br/>See Gold Point Challenge<br/><u><i>2. Silver Point Challenge (60,000)</i></u><br/>See Gold Point Challenge<br/><u><i>3. Gold Point Challenge (100,000)</i></u><br/>You are going to want to keep a x4 multiplier throughout the whole level. Break pots and kill everything that moves to maximize your score. You can also blow up the "sarcophaguses" with bombs to score some more gems. The only hard part of this level is when you have to fight two skeletons on top of spinning spike pillars. Be careful and dodge a lot so you aren’t hit, getting hit will make you lose your x4 multiplier. I didn’t get the gold point challenge done until a little ways into the final chase scene. There are gems scattered across the chase scene and arrow traps too if you need a little extra boost to get to 100,000.<br/><u><i>4. Complete Pyramid of Osiris in under 6:00</i></u><br/>Just don’t fight anything and keep running ahead. You don’t have to kill any of the enemies to complete this level.<br/><u><i>5. Collect 5 Red Skulls</i></u><br/>After cutscene of Set, use the Staff of Osiris to destroy the orb floating off to the north. The skull is in the now unlocked door.<br/>This one is floating out of reach, so grapple down to get it. The grapple point is above the unlocked door, so run up the stairs to get to it.<br/>In the large area with all the dart traps there is a blue platform that can only be raised by the Staff of Osiris. Use the staff to reach the skull.<br/>In the area where you need to put fireballs into some containers. The skull is on top of a spinning pillar in the west corner of the screen. Simply roll a fireball up next to it, jump on the ball, and the jump up on top of the pillar.<br/>After surviving the sniper ambush you will grapple up and see the skull on top of a pillar. Use the Staff to raise the pillar to the right and then jump on to the area in front of you. Now jump down onto the pillar holding the skull.<br/><u><i>6. Free a skeleton from its sarcophagus</i></u><br/>After the fireball puzzle, you will come across a room with 4 sarcophaguses. The skeleton will be in one of the sarcophaguses. Blow up the sarcophaguses with a bomb and it will be free.<br/><u><i>7. Knock 3 Skeletons onto spikes with your Remote Bombs</i></u><br/>This is easily done in the area full of spikes and dart traps. Once you venture through far enough, a bunch of skeletons will spawn. Drop a bomb down and blow the skeletons off the platforms. There are more than 3 skeleton here, so you shouldn’t have a problem.<br/><u><i>8. Destroy all of the tomb’s Arrow Traps (35)</i></u><br/>-5 are blocking the path you need to move through. This is after dodging arrows shooting across a walkway. (5)<br/>-3 are off to the right, shooting at one of Set’s orbs. This is also directly in the path that you need to move through. (8)<br/>-3 are above a broken wall. You will most likely destroy these to pass through safely. (Large spike area) (11)<br/>-3 more are Northwest of the last 3 that you've destroyed. You will see the arrows crossing over one another. (Large spike area) (14)<br/>-3 will be shooting down a longer path, from Northeast to southwest. It is on the path and hard to miss. (Large spike area) (17)<br/>-3 will be by the switch that you will need to open the door. (Large spike area) (20)<br/>-15 will be during the last chase scene. Just run by them and drop a bomb. If you miss one, just restart from the checkpoint.

Bronze Point Challenge (30,000 points)</i></u><br/>See Gold Challenge<br/><u><i>2. Silver Point Challenge (45,000 points)</i></u><br/>See Gold Challenge<br/><u><i>3. Gold Point Challenge (75,000 points)</i></u><br/>You are going to want to keep your x4 multiplier throughout the whole level or you will not have enough points. Just play it safe and break every pot and light every torch that you see, all those small gems will add up. When you are blowing open the second rumble wall, be sure to stand back as 4 or so Scarabs will rush you while you are waiting for it to blow up. Another tricky part is after the cutscene with Set. Once Set leaves, swarms of scarabs will attack you. Kill them by dropping bombs with <img src="../emoticons\face\shoubing\3.gif"/> and spamming dodge with <img src="../emoticons\face\shoubing\2.gif"/>. If you can, take a few shots with the Submachine gun otherwise just keep rolling and dropping bombs. If you do get hit, reload the checkpoint, you will keep your x4 multiplier assuming that you had it up until this point. The stairs at the end of the level can also prove to be tricky, but if you take it slow, you can get the gems without getting killed. I died once at the end of the level and still got the gold challenge by a two or three thousand, so there is room for error.<br/><u><i>4. Complete the Tomb of the Timekeeper in under 7:00</i></u><br/>This isn’t so bad, just rush through every area. You might not get this on your first playthrough, but that’s okay because you can replay the level.<br/><u><i>5. Collect 5 Red Skulls</i></u><br/>All of the Skulls are in obvious places and you should have no problem finding them. If you do need a little help, refer to the list below:<br/>Beginning of the level. Move down and to the left. You will see a bunch of gems and a grapple point. Grapple up to get the skull.<br/>You will have to push a lever about halfway through the level that activates 3 timed platforms. In between the second and third platform the skull sits out of reach. Use the grapple point located above it to snag this skull.<br/>After the last one, all you really have to do is run up the stairs. You should see it.<br/>After you survive Sets scarab assault, grab the shotgun to open the spike gate. The skull is by the grapple point. It is easier to just grapple and pull yourself up then grapple onto the grapple point and jump down directly onto the skull.<br/>When you are running up towards the stairs at the end of the level, you will see the red skull on top of one of the pillars. Simply move higher up the stairs so that you can jump onto the pillar.<br/><u><i>6. Kill 4 scarabs with a single bomb</i></u><br/>The easiest place is after the cutscene with Set. Scarabs will swarm you so drop a bomb with <img src="../emoticons\face\shoubing\3.gif"/> and detonate it by pressing <img src="../emoticons\face\shoubing\3.gif"/> again. Just make sure that you kill 4, which really shouldn’t be much of an issue. If you do run into trouble, equip a ring that increases the blast radius of the bomb.<br/><u><i>7. Destroy vase in the tomb (50)</i></u><br/>There are more than 50 vases in the tomb, but don’t go around skipping vases! Just shoot or blow up every vase you see!<br/><u><i>8. Complete the tomb without grabbing any time bombs</i></u><br/>Sounds intimidating at first, but it isn’t. All this challenge means is that you can only use your bombs to move the time bombs around. When you are by a time bomb, drop a bomb near another bomb with <img src="../emoticons\face\shoubing\3.gif"/> , and detonate it to send the time bomb flying. Just do this to maneuver the bombs to their destinations. Remember to hold <img src="../emoticons\face\shoubing\11.gif"/> to make the fuse of the time bomb longer! Also, don’t grab a hold of any of the time bombs at the end of the level, the ones that are rolling down the stairs.<br/>全挑战视频攻略：<a href="http://v.qq.com/page/v/d/0/v0162dnw7d0.html" target="_blank">Lara Croft And The Temple Of Osiris Tomb Of The Timekeeper All Challenges</a><br/><i>（视频攻略转载自<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gs1eTY9tRYk&amp;list=PL5wN4EYSaIOJfgljdMOhnqrK9MBO8PgXr" target="_blank">油管</a>，原作者D A Game Guides）</i><br/><br/><b>Tomb of the Silversmith</b><br/><u><i>1. Bronze Point Challenge (20,000)</i></u><br/>See Gold Point Challenge<br/><u><i>2. Silver Point Challenge (30,000)</i></u><br/>See Gold Point Challenge<br/><u><i>3. Gold Point Challenge (50,000)</i><br/></u>Keep your x4 multiplier throughout the whole level and you should not have a problem. The only part that might cause you some trouble is the spike room when you get swarmed by scarabs. Just spam dodges and drop bombs to kill them or at least thin them out. Also, don’t walk into Set's orbs, they damage you and you will lose your x4 multiplier! Remember to destroy pots and light torches to snag some easy gems.<br/><u><i>4. Complete Tomb of the Silversmith in under 6:00</i><br/></u>Once again, you probably won’t get this on your first playthrough. After beating the level you should be familiar with the puzzles and layout. Just make sure that you are accurate when you rotate the mirrors because you can waste a lot of time lining up the angles.<br/><u><i>5. Collect 5 Red Skulls</i><br/></u>In the corner of a room with two Set orbs. Don’t shoot the vases underneath the skull! Use them to jump up to the skull.<br/>The spike trap room. Clear out all of the scarabs and push the fireball underneath the skull. Hop up to get the skull.<br/>The big puzzle room. Complete the puzzle and head up the new path. Go left and explore that area. The skull is on a scaffolding that overlooks the puzzle area.<br/>Close to the end of the level there is a grapple point. Use it to grapple down to this easy skull.<br/>During the Apep fight. This skull is in the Northwest portion of the area.<br/><u><i>6. Skewer 10 scarabs on spike traps</i><br/></u>You can only do this in the spike trap room. Just spam rolls around the area with <img src="../emoticons\face\shoubing\2.gif"/> until 10 Scarabs are skewered by the spike traps. There are more than 10 so you shouldn’t have any problems.<br/><u><i>7. Kill a large shield skeleton with Apep’s spitfire</i><br/></u>After hurting Apep twice, he will summon a big fire skeleton. Don’t kill it! Instead let it follow you and let Apep shoot it. This will take a little patience and time because Apep’s fireballs don’t seem to hurt him that much.<br/><u><i>8. Defeat Apep in under 3:30</i><br/></u>This is extremely easy. Focus on raising the mirrors so you can reflect the laser correctly. Apep’s fireballs will not be that big of a deal and are easy to dodge. Quickly kill the summons in between his recuperation and adjust the mirrors accordingly to hit his new weak points.<br/>全挑战视频攻略：<a href="http://v.qq.com/page/k/1/v/k0162e97j1v.html" target="_blank">Lara Croft And The Temple Of Osiris Tomb Of The Silversmith All Challenges</a><br/><i>（视频攻略转载自<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gs1eTY9tRYk&amp;list=PL5wN4EYSaIOJfgljdMOhnqrK9MBO8PgXr" target="_blank">油管</a>，原作者D A Game Guides）</i><br/><br/><b>Tomb of the Ferryman</b><br/><u><i>1. Bronze Point Challenge (32,000)</i><br/></u>See Gold Challenge<br/><u><i>2. Silver Point Challenge (48,000)</i><br/></u>See Gold Challenge<br/><u><i>3. Gold Point Challenge (80,000)</i><br/></u>As usual, you will want to keep your x4 multiplier throughout the level. In addition to breaking pots and lighting torches, you will want to kill the crocodiles in the water to secure more points. If you die, restart from the checkpoint because you will most likely have lost your x4 multiplier and some points. Be careful when fighting the groups of enemies. I recommend using a shotgun to really do some damage on the enemies. I was able to get all the points before the final chase scene. If you don’t, you will have to grab gems during your escape from Ammit.<br/><u><i>4. Complete Tomb of the Ferryman in under 7:00</i><br/></u>For this one you don’t even have to fight any enemies, just keep running ahead. You probably won't get this on your first playthrough, but that’s okay because the next time you play it you will know how the level unfolds. I didn’t kill anything and just ran through.<br/><u><i>5. Collect 5 Red Skulls</i><br/></u>Near the beginning of the level. You will have to drop a bomb into the flowing water to hit the eye. Once you detonate it, drop another one in. Don’t detonate it yet, move pass the spike wall and detonate it then. The panels will flip up so you can jump across to the skull.<br/>On top of the crumbling panels. You will have to jump across to get this one.<br/>A skull is at the bottom of a staircase but is out of reach of a jump. Jump down and grab the ball at the Southern part of this area and put it on the switch. Now you can reach the skull, so jump to it.<br/>After surviving an attack in the area with a broken aqueduct you will see a red skull behind a spike wall. Use the golden lever to open up the spike wall. Now quickly run and grab the skull.<br/>In the area with the rumble wall. Shoot the golden eye once then jump down into the water. The spike wall that was protecting the red skull is now down. Swim in and grab it.<br/><u><i>6. Cross the spike ball river without touching the water</i><br/></u>This means that you will have to platform across the river instead of swimming up it. It isn’t hard; just make sure that you are accurate on your jumps. Spike balls may be able to hit you when they are falling from the ceiling, so be wary of where they fall. Like always, the location they fall is marked with a white circle.<br/><u><i>7. Use the trap platforms to dunk an enemy</i><br/></u>After passing the spike ball river you will come to an area with the trap platforms. Do not kill the enemies here, let them follow you. Use the Staff to reach the higher level and let the Sorbek Warriors jump onto the wooden trap platforms. Once they do, shoot the golden eye to drop the platforms. This will cause them to fall into the water, effectively dunking them.<br/><u><i>8. Destroy the wall without grabbing the Timebomb</i><br/></u>In the same area as above you will have to destroy a rumble wall with a time bomb. You can’t grab the bomb so you will have to use your remote bombs to push it instead. Maneuver it up onto the area where you are and then blow it over towards the wall. Make sure that you use the Staff of Osiris to prolong the fuse time on the bomb or it won’t make it.<br/>全挑战视频攻略：<a href="http://v.qq.com/page/v/r/h/v0162oz1hrh.html" target="_blank">Lara Croft And The Temple Of Osiris Tomb Of Ferryman All Challenges</a><br/><i>（视频攻略转载自<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gs1eTY9tRYk&amp;list=PL5wN4EYSaIOJfgljdMOhnqrK9MBO8PgXr" target="_blank">油管</a>，原作者D A Game Guides）</i><br/><br/><b>Tomb of the Lamplighter</b><br/><u><i>1. Bronze Point Challenge (34,000)</i><br/></u>See Gold Point Challenge<br/><u><i>2. Silver Point Challenge (51,000)</i><br/></u>See Gold Point Challenge<br/><u><i>3. Gold Point Challenge (85,000)</i><br/></u>You will NEED the x4 multiplier throughout this whole level! Without it you will never reach the score threshold. Be careful when fighting enemies; to use a shotgun to kill them quickly. Destroy every pot, kill every crocodile, and light every torch, you need every gem and point! Don’t let the enemies get killed by the boiling water; it will not give you points. When you get towards the end of the level and are running across the crumbling tiles, be sure to try to run to whatever gems you can. If you die, reload the checkpoint to get your x4 multiplier back, assuming that you had it up to that point. Also, there will be two parts during the escape sequence when you can fight enemies. Do so and try to kill them quickly, I was able to kill one on each platform before I had to start moving again. The most frustrating part is when there are arrow traps shooting across the final section of crumbling tiles. If you get hit or fall off, reload your checkpoint. Take this part as slow as the tiles allow you to, otherwise you may get shot. Watch where the arrows shoot and time your movements accordingly. Once you have made it past the arrows, there will be a few pots to destroy and a “bag” of gems surrounded by pillars. This "bag" will have enough gems in it to put your score up the last one thousand or so points that you need. There is no room for error on this challenge, so be careful!<br/><u><i>4. Complete the Tomb of the Lamplighter in under 10:00</i></u><br/>It’s not that hard. Once again, you don’t have to fight any of the enemies, except in the big water area, so run past all the ones that you can. Do the puzzles quickly and check out the Burn it with fire! trophy description if you need help with the puzzles.<br/><u><i>5. Collect 5 Red Skulls</i></u><br/>Grapple point by the third golden torch you light. It’s really easy to see!<br/>After jumping across the timed platforms you will see the red skull floating below a grapple point.<br/>After lighting the three golden torches in the room full of water a panel will raise up by an Osiris platform. Use the Staff to raise the blue platform out of the water and jump up. The skull is up on the land.<br/>After the last area above you will come to an area with a switch. The skull is on a ledge that can only be reached if you use the ball and jump on it. So blow the ball over with a remote bomb and jump on top of it.<br/>In the area with the three spinning gears. Blow the time bomb out of the water and then blow it down onto the platform below. Push it over to the red skull’s platform; there is a bit of water in between the platforms so use a bomb to blow it over. Push the time bomb underneath the skull and then jump up to get it. Remember to keep <img src="../emoticons\face\shoubing\11.gif"/> held down so that the time bomb gets a bigger fuse!<br/><u><i>6. Complete the tomb without being damaged by hot water</i></u><br/>Every golden torch that you light in this tomb is hooked up to water. Once they are lit, they will heat up the water they are connected to. This causes the water to boil and will damage you if you go into it. Just don’t go into the water when it is boiling! There really is no time where you will have to in the first place.<br/><u><i>7. Use a spike wall to kill a Sobek Warrior</i></u><br/>After lighting the third golden torch, 2 Sorbek Warriors will spawn. Let them run onto the middle platform and drop a bomb by them. Detonate it to send them flying into the spike wall. You will only have to kill one of them.<br/><u><i>8. Step on all Ammit crumbling floor tiles in exit (8/8)</i></u><br/>The Ammit tiles are the yellow tiles. Be sure to step on all of them during the final escape scene. Just take the longest way around to see where they could be.<br/>全挑战视频攻略：<a href="http://v.qq.com/page/g/7/3/g0162iisv73.html" target="_blank">Lara Croft And The Temple Of Osiris Tomb Of The  Lamplighter All Challenges</a><br/><i>（视频攻略转载自<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gs1eTY9tRYk&amp;list=PL5wN4EYSaIOJfgljdMOhnqrK9MBO8PgXr" target="_blank">油管</a>，原作者D A Game Guides）</i><br/><br/><b>Tomb of the Architect</b><br/><u><i>1. Bronze Point Challenge (26,000)</i></u><br/>See Gold Point Challenge<br/><u><i>2. Silver Point Challenge (39,000)</i></u><br/>See Gold Point Challenge<br/><u><i>3. Gold Point Challenge (65,000)</i></u><br/>Make sure that you keep your x4 multiplier throughout the whole level. You will also want to destroy all the arrow traps because they give you points as well. The trap part will be a difficult part to keep your multiplier at, but it is necessary. If you get hit, restart from the checkpoint. Also, all of the ice, fire, and arrow traps will cause some trouble if you don’t time things correctly. Take things slow until you see and opening and then take it. There's need to rush during your gold point challenge run.<br/><u><i>4. Complete Tomb of the Architect in under 7:00</i></u><br/>Once again, you don’t have to fight any of the enemies so just run through the whole level. Remember that you can speed up the spinning gears blocking your path by holding . It’s actually pretty easy getting through the level like this, I only died once from jumping wrong.<br/><u><i>5. Collect 5 red skulls</i></u><br/>Small spinning gear after you are blocked by 7 arrow traps<br/>Behind the 7 arrow traps that are firing at the spinning gear.<br/>You will have to grapple up a fire trap wall. The skull is floating halfway up the wall. Grapple all the way up and then hook the grapple back on the point and jump down onto the skull.<br/>After hopping across several gears with fire traps you will get to an area that has a bunch of fire traps on the top of it. There will be a staircase off to the northeast. Instead of venturing up, walk into the little nook by the stairs, the skull is in there.<br/>Ammit will chase you again during the last part of this level. The red skull will be on a pillar on the right side about halfway through the escape. Just jump across the pillars to get it.<br/><u><i>6. Survive the trap without taking damage</i></u><br/>The trap is about halfway through the level. You will jump onto a spinning gear that is surrounded by fire traps. To get out of the trap, you will have to kill 3 skeletons that spawn from the two orbs. They spawn one at a time so you will have to fight two at once, one in front and one in back. They shoot arrows in a burst so six arrows will be flying towards you. It is very easy to get hit here so dodging and taking accurate shots is important. You can always roll off the gear to make Lara hang onto the outside of the gear if there are too many arrows to dodge. If you do, be sure to get up quickly otherwise if you are hit there, you will fall off and die. It’s very skill based, but using strong guns helps! I used the assault rifle to kill the skeletons. After you kill the 6 skeletons, you will be able to grapple up and destroy the orb that is in charge of the fire traps.<br/><u><i>7. Destroy all arrow traps in the tomb (24)</i></u><br/>-3 are shooting Southwest to Northeast. They are just below the path being blocked by an ice trap. (3)<br/>-7 are guarding the switch you have to press to advance further into the level. (10)<br/>-7 are blocking you path after destroying Set’s first orb. (17)<br/>-7 on a platform shooting across the path. You can jump behind them and drop bombs back there. Or you can destroy them with the grenade launcher weapon if you have it.

Gold Point Challenge (100,000)</i></u><br/>As always, keep your x4 multiplier throughout the whole level. Light every torch for the gems they provide and destroy any Sarcophagus that you see. They will have gems or an enemy in them, which both provide points. The hardest place to keep your x4 multiplier is in the spike maze. You are going to want to keep your distance from the enemies and make sure that you don’t kill the enemies with the spike traps. If a spike kills them, you do not get any points. You will reach 100,000 points before the final escape sequence if you take my recommendations.<br/><u><i>4. Complete Tomb of the Torturer in under 7:00</i></u><br/>You will not have any time to fight enemies during your speed run. Run past every enemy you see and do the puzzles as quickly as possible. The spike maze will take up most of your time, so be sure to destroy the Set orb monster spawners instead of killing all the enemies. Fighting will take too much of your time. Move the fireballs as quickly as possible to their destinations and plow ahead. When you get to the scarab spawner, just run past them and hit the 3 red switches in the death panel maze. The grapple points will activate so you can swing across. Keep moving during the final escape scene and when you are trapped and ambushed by a bunch of enemies, use a shotgun or another strong gun to kill your attackers quickly. There is little room for error.<br/><u><i>5. Collect 5 red skulls</i></u><br/>After walking down the path you will see a gap off to your left. Jump over it and grab the skull.<br/>In the spike maze. Go West and you will find it in a small opening.<br/>Past the spike maze. Shoot the golden eye and then drop a bomb by it. Run to the first switch and step on it. Now detonate the bomb. The spike barrier will go down and you can now grab that red skull.<br/>In the area with the 3 switches in the spike death panel maze. It is in a dead end, so you will have to be fast or you will have to die. Either way, it still counts.<br/>After surviving the part where you get boxed in you will grapple up to a death panel part. The red skull is in the upper part of the path.<br/><u><i>6. Light every accessible brazier in the tomb (32)</i></u><br/>-1 right near the beginning, after you fall down. It’s to the left. (1)<br/>-1 by the first red skull. Jump over the gap to get to it. (2)<br/>-1 up the stairs and to the left of the last torch. (3)<br/>-2 past the last one, by some spike traps. (5)<br/>-2 in the area with the raised switch. They both are on the bottom platform, 1 is by the stairs and the other is off to the right. (7)<br/>-1 after hitting raised switch. Up the first flight of stairs. (8)<br/>-3 up the second flight of stairs. 1 to the left, 1 to the right, and 1 in between two staircases. (11)<br/>-1 by the Osiris platform after taking the bottom staircase. (12)<br/>-1 after using the timed wooden platforms to get across the spike pit. (13)<br/>-1 in the beginning of the spike maze. (14)<br/>-1 off to the right in the spike maze. (15)<br/>-1 in the middle of the spike maze. (16)<br/>-1 in the eastern corner of the maze. (17)<br/>-1 above the middle torch in the spike maze. (18)<br/>-1 in the western portion of the spike maze, it is the path leading to the last fireball. (19)<br/>-1 northeast of the last one. (20)<br/>-1 directly North of the last one, it is in the northern corner. (21)<br/>-1 by three Sarcophaguses. It is in the junction before the last fireball. (22)<br/>-1 after exiting the spike maze, it is before the golden eye switch. (23)<br/>-1 after exiting the death panel path, it is right in front of you. (24)<br/>-3 up the flight of stairs after the last one. (27)<br/>-1 above the first flight of stairs. (28)<br/>-1 in between the two flights of stairs, before the Osiris platform. (29)<br/>-1 next to the before mentioned Osiris platform. (30)<br/>-1 after pressing all the switches in the death panel path. You will have to grapple twice to get to it. It’s off to the right. (31)<br/>-1 on the flight of stairs Southeast of the last one. (32)<br/><u><i>7. Kill 10 enemies with spikes in the maze</i></u><br/>This isn’t that bad; there are a lot more enemies than 10 here. When enemies spawn, just roll around the area and hopefully the enemies will walk where the spikes once were. If they are standing were the spikes come up, roll close to them and the spikes will rise, instantly killing the enemy. Do this 10 times for this challenge.<br/><u><i>8. Survive the final battle without using weapons or bombs</i></u><br/>The final battle is when you are boxed in and have to fight some enemies. Instead of fighting them, just roll around and let the spikes skewer them.

Defeat Khepri in under 5:00</i></u><br/>You might want to get a stronger amulet and guns before attempting this, but you can try right off the bat. See the No bug is too big for these boots! trophy description if you need strategies on how to defeat this boss.<br/><u><i>2. Dodge all falling meteors</i></u><br/>The falling meteors are marked with an orange circle, so don’t go into the circle! Khepri will knock some down when you are fighting him, so just stand to the lower right on the ball and they won’t hit you. The last part of the level also has some meteors falling down upon the moving ball. The same principle applies from before: stay out of the circles!<br/><u><i>3. Dodge all of the lava fissures on Khepri’s ball</i></u><br/>Lava fissures are created when Khepri slashes at you and when meteors hit the ball. They are not difficult to dodge, just don’t walk into the gaping, smoking holes! The only difficult part is at the end of the level when the ball is rolling for the last time. Sometimes the fissures will spawn out of nowhere and damage you. Just keep your eyes open and you should be fine.<br/>全挑战视频攻略：<a href="http://v.qq.com/page/e/2/5/e0162tn9c25.html" target="_blank">Lara Croft And The Temple Of Osiris Khepri Tomb All Challenges</a><br/><i>（视频攻略转载自<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gs1eTY9tRYk&amp;list=PL5wN4EYSaIOJfgljdMOhnqrK9MBO8PgXr" target="_blank">油管</a>，原作者D A Game Guides）</i><br/><br/><b>Tomb of Sobek</b><br/><u><i>1.

Defeat Set in under 5:00</i></u><br/>This is kind of hard, but it is okay to die. I died two times and still did this challenge. You are going to want to focus on lighting the beacons with the Staff of Osiris’s laser and then lighting them with your torch. Dodge the enemies as best as you can and take the longshots into the orbs with the Staff of Osiris. Be careful of Ammit because she relights the orbs for Set. You just have to try to outrun Ammit and light your beacons faster than she can put them out. Once Set is vulnerable, hit him with the best gun that you’ve got! I used the High Powered Shotgun and Osiris’s Silver Ice Flail Amulet to take him down.<br/><u><i>2. Knock 5 enemies into the central pit</i></u><br/>Use bombs to knock heavier enemies, like Sorbek’s minions, into the pit in the middle of the area.<br/><u><i>3. Catch 5 enemies in once blast from a beacon</i></u><br/>Make sure that enemies are chasing after you and fire the Staff of Osiris at an orb. Once the orb is destroyed a steam stack will be exposed. Let at least 5 enemies get close to you and light your torch near the steam stack. This will cause an explosion which will kill all the enemies near the steam stack.<br/><u><i>4. Run between Set’s legs at least once</i></u><br/>When Osiris and Set are fighting, run over to Set and run in between his legs…<br/>全挑战视频攻略：<a href="http://v.qq.com/page/o/3/k/o016218xu3k.html" target="_blank">Tomb of Set Challenges</a><br/><i>（视频攻略转载自<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rwt-QSwwv8Q" target="_blank">油管</a>，原作者badassgamez）</i><br/><br/><i><b>OVERWORLD CHALLENGES  大地图挑战</b></i><br/><b>Solve all 5 Challenge Tombs    完成五个挑战古墓</b><br/><br/><b>Shrine of Osiris Challenge.</b><br/>The only requirement is to run over the spike panels and hit the switches.<br/><u><i>Collect 10 Red Skulls</i></u><br/>Southeast of the middle, it will be on some scaffolding.<br/>Southwest of the middle, by the spikes there.<br/>East of the middle, it will be on an Osiris platform.<br/>Directly North of middle, it will be onto of a platform with a ladder.<br/>After the Tomb of the Timekeeper, push the timebomb against the pillar and jump up to the skull.<br/>After the Tomb of the Timekeeper, destroy the rumble in the Northwest area.

Hold  the whole time or the time bomb will blow up before it can reach its destination. Push the time bomb onto the wooden platform and blow it across the river with a remote bomb, followed by jumping over and dropping another remote bomb near it. Detonate the bomb to launch it over the fire. Jump back over the river and move through the pillars. Now jump across to the time bomb. Blow it across the river again and push it on the gray platform. Drop a bomb by it but don’t detonate it. Climb on top of the time bomb and press the switch. Wait until the platform has reached its maximum height and then detonate the remote bomb. Now push the time bomb to the rumble wall to complete this challenge.<br/><u><i>Collect 5 Red Skulls</i></u><br/>On the Southern scaffolding.<br/>Eastern area, use the scaffolding to jump to the pillar.<br/>Southwestern area, you will have to jump from a ledge onto a high pillar holding the red skull.<br/>Up a long pathway on the Western side, it is the second pathway.

Fire the Staff of Osiris in a Northwestern direction at the mirror there. This will send the laser through every orb and complete this challenge.<br/> <br/>This is a bit of a longer challenge, but it isn’t very difficult. Move upwards and destroy the two Set orbs that you run into. Now get to the highest point and press the switch to knock the time bomb down. Always keep held or the fuse will run out! You will then follow the time bomb down the river and press the switches near the spike barriers to lower them to allow the time bomb to pass. The time bomb will eventually get down to a pool of water at which point you will want to remote bomb it out of the water and push it next to the rumble wall there. Past the rumble wall is another time bomb so hold  and push it out. Blow it past the water and push it up to where a Set orb use to be. Blow it up to the next level and push it onto the Osiris platform there. That means that you will have to let go of  for a little while. When it is on the platform, drop a bomb behind it to launch it onto the final platform. Once you have, push it up to the final rumble wall.
