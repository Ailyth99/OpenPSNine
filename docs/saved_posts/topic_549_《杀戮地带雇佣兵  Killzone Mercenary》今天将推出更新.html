We’re very pleased to announce the launch of the second update for Killzone: Mercenary.<br/>Firstly, we need to start off with the bad news. You’ll see that the patch size is similar to that of the previous patch, and you’ll need a spare 1190MB in order to download it. When this new patch installs, the first patch will essentially be deleted, but you will need the extra space initially. This download is necessary in order to pave the way for future planned revisions to the game.<br/>We’re currently investigating solutions to reduce the overall size of the title and free up more of your valuable memory card space. We hope to be able to share more news on that work very soon. However, it seems unlikely to us that the overall size of the downloaded game, plus the patch, will ever be under 4GB.<br/><br/><img class="imgclick" referrerpolicy="no-referrer" src="http://ww1.sinaimg.cn/large/bfae17b6tw1e9ombrwzw9j20qo0f4jxo.jpg" width="700"/><br/><br/><img class="imgclick" referrerpolicy="no-referrer" src="http://ww1.sinaimg.cn/large/bfae17b6tw1e9ombwjl42j20qo0f4n3l.jpg" width="700"/><br/><br/>The main focus for the second patch has been in targeting some of the connectivity issues that have been experienced over the last month. We’re hoping that many of you who were previously unable to connect into the community will now be able to enjoy Killzone: Mercenary to its fullest.<br/>The other main area of work has been to provide a better distribution of respawn points across all game modes. The intention here is to give a better balance to the multiplayer games.<br/>We’ve also addressed the issue that some of you were reporting with loadout slots not being unlocked, in addition to problems with the melee medal (which was always being awarded as a “bronze”).<br/>Finally, there are also a number of stability fixes, to address some of the crashes that have been reported.<br/>Please note that our previous workaround information regarding connectivity is now redundant, and it’s recommended that any steps you may have followed in order to connect should now be reverted.<br/><br/><img class="imgclick" referrerpolicy="no-referrer" src="http://ww2.sinaimg.cn/large/bfae17b6tw1e9omc2kcdfj20qo0f4q7p.jpg" width="700"/><br/><br/><img class="imgclick" referrerpolicy="no-referrer" src="http://ww2.sinaimg.cn/large/bfae17b6tw1e9ombndugaj20qo0f4dk1.jpg" width="700"/><br/><br/><img class="imgclick" referrerpolicy="no-referrer" src="http://ww4.sinaimg.cn/large/bfae17b6tw1e9ombl59ofj20qo0f4mzy.jpg" width="700"/><br/><br/>Getting everyone into games (and keeping them there) remains our number one goal on the Mercenary team. Given the myriad of network setups and usage patterns out there, we realize that issues may still arise. As such, we’ve now set up a poll to allow more detailed feedback to be given.<br/>Please be assured that we monitor the forums regularly in an effort to focus our development towards the most common issues and requests.<br/>We hope to be able to share more details on the next patch in the near future. For now though, please enjoy the updates, and continue to relay your feedback through the official forum.</div></div>
