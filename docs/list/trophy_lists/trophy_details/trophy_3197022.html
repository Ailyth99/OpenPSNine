BAHRAM Battleship<br/>Near the beginning - after Ardjet - you'll board a BAHRAM Battleship. In the third room you'll encounter your first Mummyhead. After defeating all the enemies in the room, head back towards the second room and you'll see the EX-Mission Icon waiting for you.<br/><br/>#02. Margaritifier (NEW GAME + ONLY)<br/>During your battle with Vic Viper, find the passage to Capris Canyon in the North-East section of the map. Above the passage is a terrace with a stone formation on it, shoot the formation to expose the EX-Mission Icon. You cannot go over to it, so target it and use sub-weapon Wisp to grab it.<br/><br/>#03. Margaritifier<br/>After the battle with Vic Viper, you'll fight off a bunch of Naritas. During the battle, ADA will mention reinforcements and estimate the battle time to be 90 seconds. Press  to acknowledge ADA and she'll start a 90 seconds timer, you need to defeat all remaining Naritas before the timer runs out (this is the same criteria as Flash Knock Out). If you meet this criteria, the EX-Mission Icon will appear over the passageway to Capris Canyon.<br/><br/>#04. Margaritifier<br/>On the map is a place called Sie's Lab, this is where the Metatron is. Just south of that on a lower terrace is a rock formation. Destroy the rock formation to expose the EX-Mission Icon.<br/><br/>#05. Margaritifier<br/>On the south end of the map is a train wreck, search it to find the EX-Mission Icon.<br/><br/>#06. Margaritifier<br/>On the northern edge of the area, between Sie's Lab and the passage to Capri Canyon, is a lone rock formation. Destroy it to expose the EX-Mission Icon.<br/><br/>#07. Capri Canyon<br/>Take the path to your left and follow it until the path forks; straight or left. Follow the left path and at the end of the path is a wall of rubble with the EX-Mission Icon floating in the air.<br/><br/>#08. Fort City: Depths 1<br/>Once you enter the depths of Fort City, you will be in the first area with the various pillars that move back and forth; each of these areas have 3 floors. Reach the bottom part of the first floor but before going through the door, turn around and investigate one of the two corners to find an EX-Mission Icon.<br/><br/>#09. Fort City: Depths 1<br/>Exactly the same as #08 but in the other corner of the same room.<br/><br/>#10. Fort City: Depths 1<br/>Reach the third floor of the first area and before going through the door, turn around and you should see the EX-Mission Icon in the middle of the back of the room.<br/><br/>#11. Fort City: Depths (Lloyd)<br/>During your fight with Inhert but before he makes the room go dark; go to the floor and search along the wall of the room and you should find the EX-Mission Icon.<br/><br/>#12. Underground Aumaan 1<br/>After the battle of Aumaan Crevasse, you'll be on an underground road to Aumaan; this room is structured with floors seperated by a ramped floor. You start on the first floor, when you reach the second floor there will be a small garage type building on the ground. Enter the building to find the EX-Mission Icon.<br/><br/>#13. Underground Aumaan 1<br/>After you clear the second floor and reach the third floor you should notice three metal rafters spanning the room horizontally. Destroy the three rafters and then check to your right (when entering the room) where the first rafter was to find the EX-Mission Icon.<br/><br/>#14. Underground Aumaan 2<br/>When you enter this area, simply clear the floors until you get a cutscene of Leopardo's entering the area. Clear that floor and proceed to the next floor and take notice of the single pillar sticking up in the middle of the room. The EX-Mission is at the top of that pillar.<br/><br/>#15. Underground Aumaan 2<br/>At the end of this room before the exit there are two small passageways blocked with red lasers. The EX-Mission Icon is near the ground and near these passageways but below the exit you'll need to progress through.<br/><br/>#16. Phobos<br/>After arriving on Phobos, Anubis will be trashed in a heap, though do not investigate it yet. Fly high into the sky and use  to locate the EX-Mission Icon.<br/><br/>#17. Phobos<br/>After getting the Icon in the sky, go back to the ground and fly away from Anubis towards the metal area and look around for another EX-Mission Icon.<br/><br/>#18. Phobos<br/>After investigating Anubis, he'll sink into Phobos and leave you to fight remnants of the BAHRAM forces. After defeating them you'll encounter infinitely spawning Nephtis clones. You need to destroy a certain number of these (not sure, used to be 5) to make the EX-Mission Icon spawn to the right of where Anubis used to be.<br/><br/>#19. Phobos<br/>Just like #18, after collecting that Icon keep killing Nephtis clones until another EX-Mission Icon spawns and then collect it.<br/><br/>#20. Clear Game x2<br/>Simply beat the game twice and you should earn this.</div><div class="meta"><span>2019-12-10 08:51</span></div></div></li></div></div>
