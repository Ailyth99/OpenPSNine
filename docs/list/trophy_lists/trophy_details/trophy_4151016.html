Perform an Inverted Takedown, Vent Takedown and Wall Takedown<br/>In the first predator you do (in the jamming tower building), you'll be walked through some forms of take down, including these three, so this is unmissable.<br/><br/>2. 3 Silent Takedowns in a single encounter<br/>Another easy one. You'll get this when getting Silent Knight. Just sneak behind 3 enemies separately when they don't know you are there and press  when prompted.<br/><br/>3. Finish a predator encounter unseen<br/>This isn't too difficult. You should be trying to do this in all of the predators anyway. You can do this at the same time as the silent takedowns. When taking out enemies, isolate them first so you don't get spotted, and quickly escape.<br/><br/>4. Use a Sonic Batarang to lure an enemy into a takedown<br/>Select the Sonic Batarang, then throw it near an enemy. The enemy will walk over to the batarang to inspect it. When he reaches it, fly behind him and take him down. Throwing it under a vantage point and doing an inverted takedown works too.<br/><br/>5. Complete a Predator Room without detective vision.<br/>This can be a bit annoying as you need to find the enemies manually. You can however use detective vision, remember the starting positions of enemies then restart the checkpoint. It also doesn't matter if you get spotted, so you can possibly use that to group enemies together so you know their location as long as you don't get killed in the process. In short, keep away from the  button.<br/><br/>6. Perform a Vent, Explosive Gel, Corner and Hanging Ledge takedown in one encounter<br/>The best place to do this is the bank. You are there soon after getting out of the sewer and again for the Deadshot side quest. I did it in the latter but it doesn't matter. First, the vent takedown. From the start, I entered the vent in the left corridor, then looped round to the right corridor, where there was an enemy. In the commotion, I took the opportunity to place explosive gel on both sides of a breakable wall, and waited for an enemy to pass. The corner takedown was pretty easy, I just got into cover that an enemy was walking towards and popped out when he passed. For the hanging ledge takedown, I was standing on a divider between the main room and the right corridor, threw the sonic batarang right below the ledge, and when an enemy came I took him down when prompted. All I needed to do then was finish the encounter.<br/><br/>7. Complete a Predator without using takedowns<br/>This one was annoying. You can't use takedowns at all, so you have to rely on beatdowns. You'll definitely need to isolate enemies for this, and speedily get to a vantage point after a KO. Using the disruptor and other gadgets also helps to keep you safe, and you can use the smoke pellet if you are getting shot at.<br/><br/>8. Complete a Predator without detective vision and remain unseen.<br/>This is like 5., but this time you can't get spotted, so this is even more tricky. Again, activate detective vision, study the enemies then restart checkpoint to make this easier, and if you get spotted learn from your mistakes.<br/><br/>9. Perform a Grate, Inverted, Knockout Smash and Ledge Takedown in one encounter<br/>This one actually isn't as bad as number 6 as this can be done pretty much in any predator. A good place is the hotel. (Thanks to Mullinvat) A grate takedown is inside any grate, and popping out to take out an enemy who's walking past or over. If you are struggling to get an enemy in position, use the sonic batarang. The Ledge takedown is just hanging on a ledge and pulling down an enemy off the ledge. Note, if the enemies know your location you can't hang. A knockout smash is doing a silent takedown, but finishing it quickly by hitting  in the middle of the takedown. And you've been required to do an inverted takedown before, just be on a vantage point with an enemy below you.<br/><br/>10. Complete a predator with at least a high threat level unseen.<br/>This one can be a little annoying. High threat level predators usually have a couple of armoured enemies. Use takedowns, isolation and gadgets to your full advantage so you don't get spotted.<br/><br/>11. Take out an enemy with the sonic shock batarang<br/>Select the sonic batarang, throw it at an enemy (this doesn't have to be in a predator) then hit  to detonate it, which will KO the enemy.<br/><br/>12. Complete a predator with at least a high threat level utilising at least 5 different takedowns<br/>This isn't too bad. You have done multiple different takedowns in the previous levels of the challenge. Do any 5, which should be doable on any encounter, and then finish the encounter. Example could be Silent Takedown, Ledge, Inverted, Grate and Corner takedowns.<br/><br/>13. Eliminate 3 enemies within the duration of one smoke pellet<br/>Find a group of 3 or more unarmoured enemies. If you can't get one, taking out an enemy should get them to group up a bit. Throw your smoke pellet into the group, and do a silent takedown followed by knockout smash on each one. This can be a little temperamental, so restart if it doesn't pop.<br/><br/>14. Eliminate 3 enemies with one propane tank.<br/>The best place for this IMO is the Gotham Royal Hotel. It is also possible in the GCPD, but I did it in the former. Right from the beginning, grapple to the other side of the room. You should find 3 enemies close together. Group them up with the remote claw, knock two onto the floor with the remote claw, then use the remote claw once more to attach the tank to the standing enemy. Hopefully, all 3 will be knocked out. If not, restart the encounter.<br/><br/>15. Pull 2 enemies over separate railings at the same time<br/>I did this immediately after 14. After the commotion from the propane tank, the remaining enemies were patrolling the ledges. Using the trusty remote claw once more, attach one to one enemy, and the other to another standing on a different ledge. If you did it right, they should both topple off their respective ledges. If not, they should at least be closer to the edge so do it once more.</div><div class="meta"><span>2018-09-25 02:12</span></div></div></li></div></div>
