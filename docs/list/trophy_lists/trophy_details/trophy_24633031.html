Here is my lap time for each<br/>1:33:715<br/>1:34:080<br/>1:33:940<br/>1:33:710<br/>1:33:692<br/>1:34:195<br/>1:34:826<br/>Total time: 11:08:158<br/>Week-end Sprint Race Brands Hatch: you just have to get the fastest lap for each session and finish in the first position for the two races (20min each)<br/>Fifth test at Misano: you have to do a lap time under 1:46:000 to get the gold medal. I did it with a time of 1:45:937<br/>Week-end Sprint Race Misano: you just have to get the fastest lap for each session and finish in the first position for the two races (20min each)<br/>Week-end Sprint Race Hungaroring: you just have to get the fastest lap for each session and finish in the first position for the two races (20min each)<br/>Sixth test at Nurburgring: you have to do a lap time under 2:03:000 to get the gold medal. I did it with a time of 2:02:677<br/>Week-end Sprint Race Nurburgring GP: you just have to get the fastest lap for each session and finish in the first position for the two races (20min each)<br/>Seasonal endurance tests - Paul Ricard:  you have to do a lap time under 2:03:000 to get the gold medal. I did it with a time of 2:02:392<br/>3 hours endurance race weekend at Monza: you just have to get the fastest lap for each session (5min three times) and finish in the top 3 for the race (1 hour). Work only on the disc version which is 1.7.6.1 and play offline in case. Currently not working on the latest version 1.8.11.1<br/>3 hours endurance race weekend at Silverstone: you just have to get the fastest lap for each session (5min three times) and finish in the top 3 for the race (1 hour). Only did it with the disc version 1.7.6.1 and online so don't know if it works with the latest version.<br/>Eighth test at Silverstone: not done yet. Ok I did it finally in 2:04:492 and I used dry tires instead of wet and the setup from this very useful video of Blu3_Angels. Got the gold medal with the latest version 1.8.11.1<br/>Third endurance race at Paul Ricard: not done yet. Again, doesn't work with the latest version because I got none medal after two tries! So I could get the gold medal only with the disc version again! But it was really glitchy because my car was impossible to drive when I had to break and had a hard time to block the AI opponents to make them go to the pit stop, especially the leader. So I finished the race on the second place, but it's enough to get the gold medal because remember, the requirement is just to finish on the top 3.<br/>Ninth and last test at Spa-Francorchamps: not done yet. I finally did it after more than 5 hours of trying! It's definitely not worth it to choose the Porsche GT3 for the second half of the career mode because of this event. Like Destructor_8 advised, it's better to choose the Bentley GT. Plus, I remember that I got the trophy related to SPA with this car in less than one hour. Check my Youtube video about this lap<br/>Fourth endurance race at Spa-Francorchamps: Only did it with the disc version 1.7.6.1 and online so don't know if it works with the latest version.<br/>Fifth and last endurance race at Barcelona: Only did it with the disc version 1.7.6.1 and online so don't know if it works with the latest version.<br/><br/><br/>Be aware that the lap time required for the test events that I indicated but there are not sure 100%. The lap time I did each time give me the gold medal so it will help you to have an idea of what lap time you should do so try to do like me.<br/><br/><br/><br/>Your feedback about it will be very much appreciated so don't hesitate to post here and I will update my post to be able to have the most complete career mode guide of ACC on the console version.<br/><br/><br/><br/>Update:<br/><br/>I finally got the trophy Sprint by achieving a short career mode with a gold medal!</div><div class="meta"><span>2024-09-28 17:21</span></div></div><div class="sub-comments-container"><ul class="sub-comment-list"><li><div class="content"><span class="meta"><span class="r lh180"><span class="h-p">2024-10-19 23:35</span></span></span>ynnai@wjchao这个作者叫什么，可以发个网站链接吗，谢谢</div></li><li style="border-top:none;"><div class="content"><span class="meta"><span class="r lh180"><span class="h-p">2024-10-26 05:19</span></span></span>层主@ynnaihttps://forum.psnprofiles.com/forum/14954-assetto-corsa-competizione/</div></li></ul></div></li></div></div>
