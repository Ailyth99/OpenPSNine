Spare the man at the beginning of the game, begging for help, and eventually killing him.<br/>2. Beat the first two boss fights.<br/>3. Arrive in Arkos, DO NOT flood the town, and talk to the wife in the bottom left house.<br/>4. Do the third boss fight, and travel to Kastski.<br/>5. Talk to the mage in the magic shop to learn a spell that will re-animate the man at the beginning of the game.<br/>6. Travel to the start of the game, and press“” on the dead body to reanimate.<br/>6. Travel to the start of the game, and press x on the dead body to reanimate.<br/>*You could use some spells first and replenish mana, like the familiar/doves, or shield.<br/>7. Fight the boss and win.<br/>- The boss will have a close range fire-breathing attack, but you can get the perfect spot where you are right up close, and the fire goes over your head. From here, you can melee the boss.<br/>- A few fire breaths later, and the boss will go to the roof and knock cocoons down, which will have maggots pop out. The familiar/dove is great for taking these out.<br/>- Use your healing spell/potions, and after a few rotations of the right, you should be able to beat it.</div><div class="meta"><span>2022-05-26 15:43</span></div></div></li></div></div>
