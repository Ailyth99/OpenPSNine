You need to talk to the people in the village to get access to the dungeon.<br/>1x Singing Bowl - Found in the dungeon east of the village Taswan (Tscha). You need to talk to the people in the village to get access to the dungeon.<br/>Arilla<br/>8x Sugar Tears - You get one of these for each green wasp you kill. You can't meet them in random encounters, at least I couldn't, only fightable through finding them on the world map.<br/>1x Mortar and Pestle - Found in a dungeon located at the southernmost tip of Arilla, see map for exact location. There is some dude standing outside, talk to him for the key to the dungeon. At the end of the dungeon there will be a boss, and behind the boss is the treasure chest with this item. You may want to take a left right before the boss, to go into the library and to find The Anthology.<br/>1x Emerald Scales Powder - Found in a dungeon located at the southernmost tip of Arilla, see map for exact location. There is some dude standing outside, talk to him for the key to the dungeon. Find the 5 shells he request to create the powder. They are in chests found behind some enemies. If you talk to him again you can deliver The Anthology, which he in return will give you lots of permanent stat upgrade items for.<br/>3x Wellspring Splashes - These are found in the wells, which are located on THIS map.<br/>Mordan<br/>10x Dirty Fingernails - You need to find Marauders walking around and fight them. Just like with the Sugar Tears, you will be getting one per Marauders you kill. I recommend getting Pulsating Liquid first, as that's a good place to level up/grind before facing these tough guys. Another tip is to purchase the latest weapons, at least if you can purchase weapons such as Rippled Longsword, which has +390 Strength.<br/>1x Pulsating Liquid - You get the quest from a guy in the village at the easternmost part of Mordan. He needs 4 Pulsating Slimes to create the item you need, which is dropped by Red Blobs in the dungeon surrounded by mountain in the middle of Mordan (Teardrop Mountain). You should also bring back the Moss Crystal he wants, which is behind the "last" Red Blob.<br/>3x Wellspring Splashes - These are found in the wells, which are located on THIS map.</div><div class="meta">merlinwing2015-01-27 17:48</div></div></div></div></div>
