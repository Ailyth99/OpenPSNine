And you must be Dr. Vauclair<br/>2. Eiger, why don't you tell the doc how we feel about being trapped?<br/>3. You first. Tell me what's going on here. Now.<br/>4. Try me. I'm smarter than I look.<br/>5. Well, haven't you?<br/>6. Why attack the Kreuzbasar, Vauclair? Why kill Paul Amsel?<br/>7. Your brother got us into this mess. He hired us to break into your estate. We pieced the rest together from his journals.<br/>8. I'm sorry, Doc. He was digging too deeply into Feuerschwinge, so APEX killed him.<br/>9. All for what, Vauclair? Tell me what's going to happen tonight. You owe Hermie that much.<br/>10. And I'm sure you have your reasons. I just don't *care*. Now tell me what's happening tonight.<br/>11. I understand your reasoning, but there has to be a better way.<br/>12. You don't burn a city and call it a "sacrifice." You call it what it is: mass murder.<br/>13. I'm not interested in ancient history, Vauclair. Murder is murder.<br/>14. How are you going to get Feuerschwinge to go along with this plan of yours?<br/>15. That's... horrific. Even for a mass-murdering dragon.<br/>16. This plan of yours killed your *brother*. Was it really worth it?<br/>17. Listen to reason, Vauclair. Would Hermie want you to do this?<br/>18. I've watched hours of your brother's video footage, Vauclair. I probably know him better than anyone alive, excepting yourself.<br/>19. I know that he wanted you to stop all of this years ago. He begged you to, and you promised him that you'd try.<br/>20. There are worse things out there than dragons, Vauclair. Exterminating one threat could open the door to another.<br/>21. You're wrong. An astral entity told me about... things... that exist out on the metaplanes. Horrifying things that we can't even hope to comprehend.<br/>22. Come on Doc. Think past your vendetta for a second. What if exterminating the dragons changes the landscape in a way that we can't predict?<br/>23. And what if we can't? Once you've driven the dragons extinct, you can't un-kill them. What you're really proposing to do is irrevocably change the ecosystem of our world, and you don't know what might happen as a result.<br/>24. Even if you succeed at this, eliminating dragons will create a dangerous power vacuum.<br/>25. Look, you're not infallible, Doc. You've already made mistakes here, and people died as a result.<br/>26. I've read some of your inter-office communications. There have been a number of deaths here over the years, haven't there?<br/>27. I get that they made their own decisions. But from what I was reading, it sounds like those people died from your negligence. "Basic lapses in lab safety," it said.<br/>28. My point is that everyone makes mistakes - even you. And yet, you want to roll the dice with a biological weapon.<br/>29. Bet you told your researchers that their lab would be safe, too. Look how that turned out.<br/>30. If Hermie were here with us right now, listening to this conversation, he'd tell you to stop this. Deny it if you want, but you know that it's true.<br/>31. You still have a chance to give him what he wanted. You can put a stop to this before more people get killed.<br/>32. I know that this is a hard decision, Vauclair. But it's the right one.</div><div class="meta"><span>2024-01-10 00:59</span></div></div></li><li class=''><a class="l" href="https://psnine.com/psnid/alexshyun"><img height="50" src="https://psn-rsc.prod.dl.playstation.net/psn-rsc/avatar/JP0005/CUSA01557_00-P5AVATAR00000027_103B73E3F6BF7F01D363_l.png" width="50"/></a><div class="ml64"><div class="meta pb10">alexshyun</div><div class="content pb10">主要是3个要点：<br/>1)尽早观看全部4张光盘。因为一旦你开始APEX任务后，这些光盘就不可用了。<br/>2)定期与 Absinathe 和 Aljernon 交谈。尽量每章结束都交谈，直到完成APEX准备去庄园之前把对话全部读完。<br/>3)进庄园一定要带hacker或者自己本身有4级以上能力，有2台电脑上的信息需要读完。<br/>完成以上要点之后必定能进行完楼上的对话。</div><div class="meta"><span>2024-05-08 22:18修改</span></div></div></li></div></div>
